Suggested Tools
===============

If you're a developer, you probbaly have a set of tools you are used to using.  If you're new you're probaly still exploring.
Here are a few of my favorite tools that I use for development on CalPack;

    * `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ - multi-platform editor with python support including 
      auto-complete and pylint.  
    * `Anaconda python <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ - Python distribution with built-in libraries already installed.  I also prefer its environment
      creation over pipenv
